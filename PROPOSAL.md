# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Aydan Ferrao and Haowen Xiao

# IDEAS:

1 2D Platformer with cards that give weapons.
  Scope: There will be a small cube as the player with 5ish levels. Each level will have enemies that move in straight line patterns. There will also be cards that give you weapons such as a normal gun or a sword. Each level will end with a boss that will allow you to beat the level. This is a 2D spinoff of [Neon White](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1533420/Neon_White/)

2 Chess with guns
  Scope: This will be just a clone of chess. But whenever you take a piece, the two pieces will fight each other on a seperate 2D board with the pvp mechanics similar to Tank Trouble. This will be similar to FPS Chess as a concept, but the actual chess mechanics will be similar to chess.com and the pvp will be like Tank Trouble.

3 Clone of Solitaire
  Scope: This will be a literal copy of Google's [Solitare](https://g.co/kgs/bo5NmRm)
